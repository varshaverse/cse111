The Patient Data Analytics System is a secure, multi-tier data management platform designed to help doctors efficiently manage and analyze patient medical data across multiple hospitals. 

The system includes data management tools to add, view, update, and delete patient records as well as analytical tools to identify common conditions and analyze demographic and disease trends through interactive charts. 

To protect patient privacy, identifiable information (such as name, birth date, and contact information) are excluded from the data used, ensuring compliance with data protection requirements while still allowing doctors to extract helpful statistical insights.
